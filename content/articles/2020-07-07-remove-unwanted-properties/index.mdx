## Problem

You have a JavaScript object that you got from somewhere (e.g. retrieved from
API):

```js
const restaurant = {
  name: "Nong's Khao Man Gai",
  address: "609 SE Ankeny St",
  phone: "503-740-2907",
  secretKeyLocation: "somewhere",
};
```

However, you want to remove `secretKeyLocation` before passing the object onto
the next part of the workflow.

## Solution: Destructure/Rest Syntax

The combination of [object destructuring][destructure] and [object literal
spread/rest syntax][spread] to the rescue â›‘.

```js
const { secretKeyLocation, ...rest } = restaurant;

doSomethingWith(rest);
```

With this, you now have three variables:

- `secretKeyLocation` with the value of `"somewhere"`
- `rest`, a new object with the value of:

  ```js
  {
    name: "Nong's Khao Man Gai",
    address: "609 SE Ankeny St",
    phone: "503-740-2907",
  }
  ```

- `restaurant` which is untouched and retains its original value. Immutability
  FTW ðŸ™Œ!
