import Home from "./helpers/Home";

Right now I think a lot about:

- [React][]
- Web accessibility
- Web design system
- Sustaining a healthy team
- Social justice
- Working across 7 different time zones

I lead a team of 9 web front-end developers, supporting legacy apps, as well as
developing new ones. **Every single member of the team is underrepresented in
the software industry** üòç.
