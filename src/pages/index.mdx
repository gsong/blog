Right now I think a lot about:

- Sustaining a healthy team
- Social justice, in context of our society and the workplace
- The principle that everything should be as simple as it can be, but not
  simpler
- Web accessibility
- [React][]
- Working across 7 different time zones

I lead a team of 9 web front-end developers around the globe. **Every single
member of the team is underrepresented in the software industry** üòç.
